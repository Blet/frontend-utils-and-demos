This is a collection of my frontend utilities and demos.

### Dependencies

Most of them are implemented without using any libraries or frameworks.

### Compatibility

Most of them are tested on IE8 and the latest stable release of Chrome and Firefox. If they need HTML5, CSS3 or other feature that are not supported by lower versions of IE, I will point it out in the readme.
